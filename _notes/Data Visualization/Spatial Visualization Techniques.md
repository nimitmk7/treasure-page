# Spatial Visualization Techniques
## Categorization of common techniques

| Objects                               | Densities                                                   | Values                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dot Maps**(Distribution of Objects) | **Heat Maps**(Distribution of values, continuous)           | **Choropleth Maps**(Distribution of values, discrete/geo) |
|                                       | **Binned Maps**(Distribution of values, discrete/arbitrary) | **Symbol Maps**(Distribution Maps, discrete/geo)          |
## Dot Map
- Each item is mapped to its location.
- Useful to depict distribution of events and geo-located objects.
- Dot color and size can encode additional information

### Example

## Heat Map
- Used to visualize the continuous distribution of a quantity.
- Typically use a "density estimation" method, which estimates a continuous density model from discrete data.

### Color Map
- Color really matters.
- Most common color map are Rainbow and Jet, but they are not very suitable. Converting them to B&W, we see that brightness does not decrease/increase monotonically, when we go from Left to Right.
- Not very helpful as when we look at heat map, we tend to pick out light or dark regions rightaway.

> [!WARNING] DO NOT USE RAINBOW/JET COLOR SCHEME

#### Recommended ColorMaps

- **Viridis** and **Heat**: Light to Dark
- **Cool Warm**: Dark to light to Dark (Bidirectional, so very useful to represent diverging data).

## Binned Map
- Visualize discrete distribution of values.
- Binned map partition space into discrete bins. 
- Color encodes aggregated quantity over each bin.
### Example

## Choropleth Map
We frequently want to show how some quantity varies across locations. We can do so by coloring individual regions in a map according to the data dimension we want to display. Such maps are called **choropleth** maps.
### Example

1. Distribution of information
![[chloropleth.png.png]]
2. Categorical information

![[spat_example.png]]
3. Focus on the foreground

## Symbol Map
- Uses symbol in particular size to associate quantity associated with the region.
- Does not depend on region's size/shape.
- Easier to use multiple channels(color, shape)
- Does not solve the spatial density problem.

### Example

## Cartograms
Not every map-like visualization has to be geographically accurate to be useful. 

A cartogram is a thematic map of a set of features, in which their geographic size is altered to be directly proportional to a selected variable, such as travel time, population, or Gross National Product. This helps convey information of that variable.

### Example
- Original Chloropleth map

- Cartogram with shape corrected for population in each state.

### Cartogram Heatmap
- Each region is represented using an equally sized square.
