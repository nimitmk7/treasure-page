Data visualization is part art and part science. The challenge is to get the art right without getting the science wrong, and vice versa. 

1. A data visualization first and fore‚Äêmost has to accurately convey the data. It must not mislead or distort.
2. Data Visualization should be aesthetically pleasing as they enhance the message of the visualization.

## Ugly, Bad and Wrong Figures

**Ugly** : A figure that has aesthetic problems but otherwise is clear and informative
**Bad** : A figure that has problems related to perception; it may be unclear, confusing, overly complicated, or deceiving
**Wrong**: A figure that has problems related to mathematics; it is objectively incorrect
