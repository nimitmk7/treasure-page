A classification of various visualization techniques into generic groups based on their purpose, type and function.

E.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Charts
## Problems

### Quantity Problem
- Chart taxonomy tries to exhaustively enumerate all different chart types, which can be very time-taking.
- One can't rely on it for creating novel charts.
- Quantity is not an indication for . Support for more charts does not mean it is a better tool. What we care about is creating the chart of our choice.
- Using taxonomy, Composition is also not very well supported. For example, a tool supports 10 basic chart types. If we want to combine 2 of them, there are 100 combinations possible.

### Flexibility Problem
- Ways of customizing each chart is often limited.
- Even simple changes can be frustratingly hard if possible at all.
- Thus all charts look similar.

### Rigid Mental Model
- Chart is more like a dish created from recipes. Taxonomy does not capture this relationship.
- Grouping/distinguishing charts in taxonomy can feel confusing and arbitrary. As most chart types have similar ingredients, and similar methods to represent data.
